# GreenDen Project
I developed a multi-page website for GreenDen Nursery using HTML and Tailwind CSS. The site is fully responsive, ensuring a smooth user experience across both mobile and desktop devices. I used Tailwindâ€™s utility-first classes to rapidly build a clean and modern design, while keeping the code lightweight and easily maintainable. The website includes multiple pages for different sections, all styled with custom configurations to maintain consistency and visual appeal.
